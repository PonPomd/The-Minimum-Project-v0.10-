# The-Minimum-Project-v0.10-
You play as Hiroshi, an average if vertically-challenged student at Saisho Academy. After agreeing to assist the science club president with one of her newest inventions, something goes terribly wrong and you find yourself stuck at 1/100th of your normal height. Seek out someone to help you grow back while trying (or not) to avoid getting killed by unaware or malicious giantesses!​
