# The-Minimum-Project-v0.10-
Description

Get ready to experience a bold and surreal adventure in The Minimum Project, where the ordinary becomes extraordinary—and you’ve literally shrunk to make it happen. You step into the shoes of Hiroshi, an unassuming student at Saisho Academy, who volunteers to help with a science club invention… only to find himself reduced to 1/100th of his normal height. 

Now tiny in a world of giants, you must navigate a school filled with towering classmates and perilous environments. As you explore this microscopic existence, your survival hinges on stealth, strategy and alliances. Meet, interact and build relationships with the towering women around you—how you engage them affects dialogue, events and scenes thanks to an affinity/affection system. 

Dive into scripted events, striking CG artworks and mini-games that challenge your perspective—literally. There are no traditional RPG random encounters or grind-loops; instead you’ll engage with unique battle-scenes, interactive set-pieces and story-driven mechanics. 

Will you escape your miniature fate? Or will you become lost under giant boots, trapped in a backpack, or swallowed in a single gulp? Explore, survive, and discover just how small the world can make you feel.

Unique premise: The “shrinking” and giantess fantasy genre is rare—The Minimum Project brings it front-and-center with tangible gameplay consequences.

No grinding, no filler: Focused gameplay, clear events, and a guide to track scenes mean you don’t waste time figuring out what to do. 

Dynamic character interactions: Your decisions affect how characters treat you—open paths to different scenes, get swallowed, rescued or dominated by giant classmates.
